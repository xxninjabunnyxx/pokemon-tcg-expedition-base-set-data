  text: Once during your turn, instead of Alakazam's normal attack, you may choose
    1 of your opponent's Pokémon's attacks. Alakazam copies that attack including
    its Energy costs and anything else required in order to use that attack, such
    as discarding Energy cards. (No matter what type that Pokémon is, Alakazam's type
    is still Psychic.) This power can't be used if Alakazam is affected by a Special
    Condition.
